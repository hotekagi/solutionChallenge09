   You can also toggle "Filter to Chat only" on, focusing on chat message.

2. Push "Start Tracking" to start facial emotion recognition.

   Tracking of facial features is implemented by using [clmtrackr, Copyright (c) 2017 Audun Mathias Ã˜ygard](https://github.com/auduno/clmtrackr).

   You can see how your emotion was recognized at the bottom of the page. When you want to stop the recognition, push "Stop Tracking".

   This page only send the results of the recognition without exchange unnecessary information. This preserve your privacy.

   Otherwise, wait until speaker's streaming starts.
   When you want to stop watching it, push "Hung Up".

### speaker

   You can send chat message, receive message and emotions from viewers and toggle "Filter to Chat only" on, focusing on chat message.

   Speaker can edit chapter structure by the text area below,
   and select which chapter is in progress.
   Changing the chapter also changes the viewer side.

2. Push "Turn On Camera" to say hello.

3. Push "Share Screen" to start lecture with your materials on the device.

4. Don't forget to push "Start Recording" to save your lecture video on the server.

   This app stop recording for saving and uploading it to the server when you push "Stop Recording" or switch between camera and screen sharing.

   These video files are saved to `app/video-uploads` in webm format. The audio in the video is also converted to mp3 file, transcribed, and summarized in txt file.

5. Summarize and create potential questions for students to review by "Chose File" and "Upload PDF".

   The result can see at `app/pdf-data`, pdf file and summary txt file.

<br>

When you put `?room={some_id} ` at the end of the URL,
another meeting room can be generated according to the value.
This makes it possible to have multiple meetings on one server at the same time by having the speakers and viewers share the room id in advance and having each meeting use a different room.

If you intend to make it publicly accessible and use it across different terminals, use

- ngrok (https://ngrok.com/docs/getting-started/)

```shell
$ npm start
$ ngrok http 9001
